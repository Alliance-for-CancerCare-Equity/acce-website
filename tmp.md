I need help with this website I am making, this is a website I am making for a charity, I have already built out a number of pages but wanna build out more. The charity founder wants the new website to mirror the content and structure of the old website. Can you read the codebase and go to these websites:



First, can you go through this codebase to understand the code. This is an Astro codebase, this started out as a template that I've worked on to get to this state. I work with this charity (Alliance for Cancer Care Equity) and am building them a new website.

Can you read all of these website pages. These are the original website pages for the organization. It was made by a single guy (the founder) in wix, he has no branding or website or any experience at all. My goal is to transform the information into a new improved website with this project. I want to improve everything, design choices, number of pages, layout, organization. I want everything done professionally, can you help me with that, here are all the websites:
