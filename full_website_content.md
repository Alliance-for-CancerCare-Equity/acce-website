## Page: Projects Overview

**Title:** Advancing Equity in Cancer Care
**Subtitle:** Cancer continues to be a major global health challenge, with significant implications, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. By 2030, it is anticipated that the region will experience over 1 million deaths and more than 1.4 million new cases annually.

Disturbingly, Africa is also projected to bear half of the world's childhood cancers by 2050*. In Ghana alone, despite an estimated 24,000 new cases each year among its 31 million population, only approximately 3,500 patients receive treatment annually—highlighting a stark disparity. Tragically, around 15,800 lives are lost to cancer yearly in the country**. Financial constraints further exacerbate this crisis, with over half of treated patients unable to afford to complete their treatment.

Addressing this urgent issue, Alliance for CancerCare Equity (ACCE) champion’s health equity by:

- Covering the expenses for the full spectrum of cancer treatments, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery, and associated costs, for patients in Ghana who lack the financial means to access adequate healthcare services.
- Providing financial support for cancer treatments to uninsured and underinsured patients in Canada (Kitchener-Waterloo).
- Assisting with the costs of essential, yet unfunded, medications for patients in Canada (Kitchener-Waterloo).
- Offering access to supportive networks and counseling services for cancer patients and their families.
- Providing essential medical equipment for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with cancer in non-profit community healthcare centers.
- Conducting vital research into cancer and other diseases to advance understanding and management in both Canada and Ghana.

### Project: Fund Cancer Treatment and Related Costs
**Title:** We Fund Cancer Patients Treatment and Related Costs
The Alliance for CancerCare Equity (ACCE) is committed to ensuring that a patient's family finances never determine their ability to survive cancer. ACCE achieves this mission by funding the full spectrum of cancer treatments, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery, and associated costs, for patients in Ghana who lack the financial means to access adequate healthcare services; providing financial support for cancer treatments to uninsured and underinsured patients in Canada (Kitchener-Waterloo); and covering the costs of essential medications that are not funded for patients in Canada (Kitchener-Waterloo).

ACCE's dedication extends beyond financial assistance. We alleviate the burden of treatment costs for patients who cannot afford them, enabling them to focus entirely on their recovery. Additionally, we offer emotional support to both cancer patients and their families, ensuring they can navigate this challenging journey with peace of mind and focus on their health and well-being.

### Project: Support Community Healthcare Centers
**Title:** We Equip Non-Profit Community Healthcare Centers
The Alliance for CancerCare Equity (ACCE) equips non-profit community healthcare centers in Ghana and Canada with the essential diagnostic and treatment equipment needed for quality cancer care. We source, ship, and donate fit-for-purpose equipment so care teams can deliver timely screening, diagnosis, and treatment.

Beyond delivery, we handle end-to-end readiness and sustainability: site assessments, installation and commissioning, and hands-on training for frontline staff with biomedical engineers. We also help set up maintenance programs and consumables supply so equipment remains reliable over time.

Typical equipment includes infusion pumps and chairs, ultrasound units for guided procedures, pathology and lab analyzers, radiation planning workstations, and essential monitoring devices. Where needed, we also support facility readiness—power conditioning, climate control—to protect equipment, minimize downtime, and improve patient throughput and outcomes.

We understand the importance of emotional support in the journey through cancer, ensuring every individual receives compassionate care and guidance when they need it most.

Our support extends beyond counseling. We connect patients with navigation resources, financial assistance for unfunded essentials, transportation support, and respite options for caregivers. By coordinating with community partners and care teams, we help families manage the practical burdens of treatment so they can focus on healing.

We also promote peer-support groups, survivorship programming, and culturally safe services that honor the values and preferences of each family. From diagnosis through survivorship, ACCE works alongside patients to reduce isolation, improve access to care, and build stronger support networks in both Canada and Ghana.

### Five Ways to Make an Impact This Giving Tuesday (Dec 2, 2025)
Imagine a world where everyone had access to cancer care whether they could afford it or not. That’s what the Alliance for CancerCare Equity (ACCE) is trying to achieve through the support of generous donors.

GivingTuesday is the world’s largest generosity movement. Founded in 2012, its goal is to establish an annual day dedicated to giving. Whether you’re a repeat supporter or someone looking for a meaningful way to give back, here are five ways to make an impact this Giving Tuesday, Dec. 2, 2025:

1. **Organize a fundraiser for ACCE**: ACCE was created in 2022 to support patients who can't afford cancer treatment. Since then, the charity has raised over $100,000 for this cause. Your fundraiser could be a walk, run or even a drive. Set a goal of how much you want to raise per kilometer walked or run and aim to achieve it. Consider wearing branded merchandise to spread the word about your fundraiser. You can also partner with local businesses to encourage people to both shop locally while donating to the charity.

2. **Spread the word about the importance of giving**. Social media has become a tool where everyone can stay connected no matter their location. And one of its biggest impacts is amplifying awareness about a cause. So, even if you can’t be physically present to organize a fundraiser, you can share a post, story, or testimonial to inspire others to give. On and before Giving Tuesday, share graphics, and promotional posts using hashtags. Don’t forget to share the donation link and tag ACCE for the possibility of future donations.

3. **Volunteer for ACCE.** Many nonprofit organizations rely on volunteers to run. Volunteering with ACCE for even a couple of hours weekly can ramp up donations on Giving Tuesday. You can help by phoning or emailing past donors to consider donating on Giving Tuesday, creating social media posts to spread awareness, planning events and helping with administrative tasks. Please send an email to [volunteer@allianceforcancercareequity.ca](mailto:volunteer@allianceforcancercareequity.ca) if you’re interested in volunteering.

4. **Make a one-time donation**. As obvious as this sounds, it’s the most important way to give back. Charities need money to further their cause. Consider donating to the Alliance for CancerCare Equity to fund life-saving treatments for patients in need. Even the smallest contribution can make a big difference. A single donation helps fund critical services, including providing treatment support, providing medication, and supporting families.

5. **Become a regular donor**: Signing up to be a regular donor is one of the most impactful ways to sustain a nonprofit’s mission year-round. You can opt to be a monthly donor where your $10 or $20 monthly donations create a reliable, ongoing impact. A predictable source of donation allows ACCE to plan programs more effectively, respond to urgent patient needs, and support long-term research initiatives.

Giving Tuesday is more than just one day of generosity, it’s a reminder that everyone can collectively change the lives of those around us. Whether you donate, volunteer, fundraise, or simply share the message, your support helps move us closer to our mission of ensuring that every cancer patient receives equitable, high-quality care, regardless of their financial status. Please consider donating to the [Alliance for CancerCare Equity](https://www.allianceforcancercareequity.ca/giving-options).

### Stomach Cancer is Silent (Gastric Cancer Awareness)
**Gut Feelings Matter**
November recognizes Gastric Cancer, also known as stomach cancer, which forms when there’s a genetic mutation in the DNA of your stomach cells. This in turn can lead to a rapid growth eventually forming a tumor. These cancer cells can also spread to other parts of the body.

**Why Awareness Matters**
Causes of these mutations are still unknown to researchers. Spreading awareness to the many ways cancer can form and quickly spread in the body may allow for further support and avoiding a late diagnosis. Gastric cancer does not receive as much attention as other cancers, yet awareness may support early detection and save lives. Early detection drastically improves survival rate, also allowing for the opportunity to modify risk factors. Increasing awareness helps others recognize early symptoms, understand their risk factors and seek immediate medical attention.

**Equal Care. Equal Lives**
Unfortunately, there is a great divide in regards to healthcare, where many are unable to receive equal opportunities in finding resources, screenings, or followups. Outcomes should not depend on the form of income, or the postal code in which one resides. Marginalized and high-risk communities often face barriers such as poverty, language and lack of physicians. Health equity is a matter of justice that ACCE supports.

**Know the signs. Fight the Silence**
Gastric Cancer is a disease in which cancer cells form in the lining of the stomach. Gastric cancer symptoms often don’t appear in the early stages. However, symptoms include the following:
- Loss of appetite
- Trouble swallowing
- Fatigue or weakness
- Nausea and vomiting
- Unexplained weight loss
- Heartburn and indigestion
- Feeling bloated or gassy after eating
- Stomach pain, often above your belly
- Feeling full even after eating a small meal or snack

Most of these symptoms are common in other conditions too. It is highly advised to seek out your healthcare provider for greater details.

**How can you make a difference this November?**
1. Join us in spreading awareness: Share this link to help spread awareness regarding Gastric cancer. Talk about it with your relatives and friends.
2. Donate to ACCE: Donating to ACCE will allow greater support in funding patients' treatment for those in Ghana who cannot afford their treatment cost and for those in Canada who cannot afford unfunded drugs. It also helps fund patients lab tests, screening, and transportation.
3. Engage with us online: Engagement may boost visibility and allow us to reach others in need of further support.

### Turning Breath Into Hope (Lung Cancer Awareness)
**Turning Breath Into Hope**
November is Lung Cancer Awareness Month. For thousands of families, this month is not just symbolic — it is a reminder of a disease that continues to take more lives than any other cancer.

At ACCE (Alliance for CancerCare Equity), our focus is simple: **no one should be denied timely screening, treatment, or support because of where they live or what they earn.**

**Why lung cancer awareness matters**
Lung cancer accounts for the highest number of cancer-related deaths worldwide. In Canada, it represents roughly one in four cancer deaths. Many diagnoses still happen too late. When cancer is detected early, survival rates increase significantly. When it is found late, options become limited. This is the gap ACCE fights to close.

**Understanding the causes**
Lung cancer has several known causes. Awareness of these factors helps communities reduce risk:
- **Smoking and secondhand smoke** – The leading risk factor. Long-term exposure damages lung cells and increases the likelihood of developing cancer.
- **Air pollution** – Persistent exposure to polluted environments raises risk, especially in urban and industrial regions.
- **Radon gas** – A naturally occurring radioactive gas that can accumulate in homes and buildings. Long-term exposure is a major non‑smoking cause.
- **Occupational exposure** – Materials like asbestos, diesel exhaust, and certain chemicals elevate risk for workers in high‑exposure fields.
- **Family history and genetic factors** – Some people develop lung cancer with no smoking history due to genetic predispositions or unknown factors.

Understanding these causes encourages prevention, screening, and informed decisions for families.

**Recognizing early symptoms**
Lung cancer often goes unnoticed in early stages. Knowing the symptoms can change outcomes:
- Persistent cough lasting more than three weeks
- Shortness of breath
- Chest pain that worsens with deep breathing
- Unexplained weight loss
- Hoarseness or voice changes
- Coughing up blood
- Frequent lung infections

No symptom alone confirms lung cancer, but timely medical evaluation is critical. **Early detection saves lives.** It also reduces financial, emotional, and physical strain.

**Why equity in care matters**
Not everyone receives the same level of screening or follow-up care. Communities in rural areas, low-income households, and marginalized groups face higher risks due to:
- Limited access to diagnostic centres
- Longer travel distances
- Delayed referrals
- Financial constraints
- Lack of awareness about screening programs

ACCE’s mission is to eliminate these barriers. We support patients through education, advocacy, financial assistance, community outreach, and partnerships with healthcare teams.

**How you can support lung cancer patients this November**
1. **Donate to ACCE**: Your donation helps fund transportation, screening support, caregiver education, and advocacy programs across Canada and Ghana.
2. **Share educational resources**: Sharing this blog increases reach and ensures more people learn the symptoms, risks, and importance of early screening.
3. **Engage with ACCE online**: Every like, comment, or share boosts visibility and helps us reach more families who need support.

**Hope begins with awareness**
This November, we stand stronger together. Lung cancer is not just a disease of statistics. It is a human challenge that demands action, compassion, and education. When you support ACCE, you help ensure that every patient — regardless of background or income — has a fair chance at survival and quality care.

**Join the fight. Donate today. Share the message. Help us build health equity for all.**

## Events

### Empowering Communities: A Cancer Awareness and Education Event (2026)
**Promoting Prevention, Screening, Early Detection, and Equitable Access to Cancer Care**

**Date:** March 28, 2026
**Time:** 9:00 AM – 3:00 PM
**Venue:** Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI): 67 Erb St. W, Waterloo, ON

**Event Overview**
The Alliance for CancerCare Equity, in partnership with the Waterloo Wellington Regional Cancer Program (Ontario Health: Cancer Care Ontario), the KW4 Ontario Health Team, SCOPE (a virtual support team for primary care providers), K-W Immigration Partnership Council and the International Migration Research Centre warmly invites you to a special transformative community event dedicated to cancer education, awareness, prevention, and early detection.

This is more than just an event, it’s a movement toward health equity, informed communities, and empowered individuals. Whether you are a community member, caregiver, healthcare professional, or someone affected by cancer, your presence matters.

**Goal**
Increase cancer awareness, encourage early detection and screening, and educate minority communities (Blacks, immigrants, etc.) about cancer prevention, treatment, survivorship and to honor Margaret Walton Roberts, IMRC co-founder and past IP Council member.

**Target Audience**
*   Black and racialized communities
*   New immigrants and Newcomers
*   General public in Kitchener-Waterloo Region

**Why Attend?**
Cancer is not an equal opportunity disease. Systemic barriers, cultural stigma, and lack of access to the right information continue to negatively impact outcomes for minority communities in Canada. Many are diagnosed late or unaware of the services available to them. Thus, cancer outcomes remain significantly worse for racialized and immigrant populations in Canada, often due to misinformation, cultural stigma, and lack of access to prevention and screening resources.

However, **Early detection saves lives.** Access to information changes outcomes.

Together, we can build a future where everyone has an equal chance at cancer prevention, treatment, and survival.

**Key Messages**
*   Importance of screening and early detection. Screening guidelines and access
*   Cancer prevention and modifiable risk factors (diet, lifestyle). Understanding risk factors
*   Cancer in Black and immigrant communities: understanding the data
*   Access to screening services
*   Treatment options and care pathways
*   Navigating treatment and survivorship
*   Available resources
*   Navigating the Canadian healthcare system
*   Addressing cultural myths, misinformation and barriers to equitable healthcare
*   Reducing systemic barriers to care

**What to Expect**
*   Expert-led education sessions on cancer awareness and prevention
*   Culturally relevant discussions on reducing barriers to care
*   Practical guidance for early screening and self-advocacy
*   Connection with healthcare providers and community support organizations
*   An inclusive, supportive space for learning, sharing, and taking action
*   Honoring Margaret Walton Roberts, IMRC co-founder and past IP Council member

**Event Format**
