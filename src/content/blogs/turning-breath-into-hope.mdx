# Turning Breath Into Hope

> November is Lung Cancer Awareness Month. For thousands of families, this month is not just symbolic — it is a reminder of a disease that continues to take more lives than any other cancer.

At ACCE (Alliance for CancerCare Equity), our focus is simple: **no one should be denied timely screening, treatment, or support because of where they live or what they earn.**

## Why lung cancer awareness matters

Lung cancer accounts for the highest number of cancer-related deaths worldwide. In Canada, it represents roughly one in four cancer deaths. Many diagnoses still happen too late. When cancer is detected early, survival rates increase significantly. When it is found late, options become limited. This is the gap ACCE fights to close.

## Understanding the causes

Lung cancer has several known causes. Awareness of these factors helps communities reduce risk:

- **Smoking and secondhand smoke** – The leading risk factor. Long-term exposure damages lung cells and increases the likelihood of developing cancer.
- **Air pollution** – Persistent exposure to polluted environments raises risk, especially in urban and industrial regions.
- **Radon gas** – A naturally occurring radioactive gas that can accumulate in homes and buildings. Long-term exposure is a major non‑smoking cause.
- **Occupational exposure** – Materials like asbestos, diesel exhaust, and certain chemicals elevate risk for workers in high‑exposure fields.
- **Family history and genetic factors** – Some people develop lung cancer with no smoking history due to genetic predispositions or unknown factors.

Understanding these causes encourages prevention, screening, and informed decisions for families.

## Recognizing early symptoms

Lung cancer often goes unnoticed in early stages. Knowing the symptoms can change outcomes:

- Persistent cough lasting more than three weeks
- Shortness of breath
- Chest pain that worsens with deep breathing
- Unexplained weight loss
- Hoarseness or voice changes
- Coughing up blood
- Frequent lung infections

No symptom alone confirms lung cancer, but timely medical evaluation is critical. **Early detection saves lives.** It also reduces financial, emotional, and physical strain.

## Why equity in care matters

Not everyone receives the same level of screening or follow-up care. Communities in rural areas, low-income households, and marginalized groups face higher risks due to:

- Limited access to diagnostic centres
- Longer travel distances
- Delayed referrals
- Financial constraints
- Lack of awareness about screening programs

ACCE’s mission is to eliminate these barriers. We support patients through education, advocacy, financial assistance, community outreach, and partnerships with healthcare teams.
