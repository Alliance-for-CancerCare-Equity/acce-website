# Turning Breath Into Hope

## November and the Global Fight Against Lung Cancer

November is Lung Cancer Awareness Month — a time to confront the leading cause of cancer deaths and close the gap in who gets timely screening, treatment, and support.

For many, breathing is unconscious. We inhale, we exhale, and we continue with our day. But for millions facing lung cancer, every breath is a reminder of a battle that is often fought in the shadows of stigma and late diagnosis.

At the Alliance for CancerCare Equity (ACCE), we see lung cancer not just as a medical challenge, but as a crisis of equity. The difference between survival and tragedy often comes down to where you live and whether you can afford care.

## The Reality of Lung Cancer

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it accounts for the highest number of cancer deaths globally.

The challenge is often silence. Symptoms can be subtle—a persistent cough, shortness of breath, chest pain—and are easily dismissed until the disease has advanced.

But the greater silence is the stigma. For decades, lung cancer has been solely associated with smoking. While tobacco use is a primary risk factor, it is not the only one. Environmental pollutants, genetic factors, and workplace exposures also play significant roles.

This stigma can delay diagnosis and isolate patients. No one deserves cancer, and everyone deserves care.

## Why Early Detection Matters

The most powerful tool against lung cancer is catching it early.

When detected at an early stage, survival rates increase dramatically. Screening programs using low-dose CT scans have been proven to save lives. However, access to these screenings is not universal.

In high-income countries, screening is becoming more common. In low- and middle-income countries, it is often nonexistent or prohibitively expensive.

This is where the equity gap widens. A patient in Canada may have access to advanced screenings and targeted therapies, while a patient in Ghana may not be diagnosed until it is too late for effective intervention.

## ACCE’s Commitment to Equity

ACCE believes that geography should not determine destiny.

Our mission is to support patients across the continuum of care—from diagnosis to treatment. This includes:

- **Supporting Treatment Costs:** Helping patients afford chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and essential medications.
- **Navigating Care:** Guiding patients through complex healthcare systems in both Canada and Ghana.
- **Advocating for Access:** Raising awareness that lung cancer can affect anyone and that equitable access to care is a human right.

## Stories of Resilience

Behind the statistics are real people.

We have supported patients who, despite the odds, continue to fight for more time with their families. We have seen the relief in a family’s eyes when they realize they do not have to choose between food and medication.

Every donation to ACCE helps bridge the gap. It turns despair into hope and isolation into community.

## How You Can Help

This November, let’s turn awareness into action.

1.  **Educate Yourself and Others:** Break the stigma. Lung cancer can affect anyone with lungs.
2.  **Support Patients:** Your donations directly fund treatment for those who cannot afford it.
3.  **Advocate for Equity:** Share the message that cancer care must be accessible to all, regardless of income or location.

Together, we can ensure that every patient has a fighting chance.
