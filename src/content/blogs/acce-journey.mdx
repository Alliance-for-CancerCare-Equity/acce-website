# ACCE Journey

## How a Vision for Equity Became a Lifeline for Cancer Patients Across Borders

The journey of the Alliance for CancerCare Equity (ACCE) did not begin with an organization or a boardroom discussion. It began more than a decade ago with a simple and heartbreaking observation.

During visits to Ghana, Dr. Ernest Osei, President and CEO of ACCE, noticed a heartbreaking pattern at one of the cancer centers. Patients who had started treatment, suddenly stop turning up for treatment, only to come back when the disease has gotten worse. This is not because the treatment was ineffective, but because they could no longer afford paying for the treatment. Several published articles also confirmed what he was seeing firsthand: More than half of patients who manage to start cancer treatment in Ghana never complete it. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cancer outcomes are significantly worse in low- and middle-income countries due to limited access to early diagnosis, treatment, and supportive care.

With only three cancer centers serving a population of over 30 million people, the scale of inequity in Ghana was impossible to ignore.

The original dream was ambitious. Build a cancer center in Ghana where patients who could not afford care would be treated for free. But the capital required was immense. Rather than abandon the mission, the vision evolved.

In 2022, after conversations with friends who shared the same concern, ACCE was born with a clear purpose: to ensure that limited financial resources are never the reason someone dies from cancer, regardless of where they live.

## A Borderless Approach to Cancer Care

What makes ACCE unique is not only where it works, but how it works.

Cancer does not recognize borders. Yet access to care does. ACCE exists to bridge that gap by supporting patients in both Ghana and Canada, ensuring equity in treatment regardless of income, geography, or background.

ACCE’s approach is rooted in five core principles:

- **Equity-driven care**, not just awareness or advocacy
- **Patient-centered support**, across all cancer types
- **Holistic assistance**, including treatment costs, navigation, and education
- **Focus on the overlooked**, underserved, and underinsured communities and people
- **A bold, global vision** that aims to change systems, not just outcomes

Unlike many cancer charities that focus on a single disease, ACCE supports all types of cancer. The priority is not the diagnosis. It is the person.

Once ACCE commits to a patient, the organization stays with them throughout their treatment journey, helping them navigate healthcare systems, access medication, and complete life-saving care.

## Impact That Changes Lives

Since 2022, ACCE has supported 67 cancer patients across Ghana and Canada.

In the past year alone (2025), 20 patients in Ghana received support for radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery, lab tests, transportation, and essential cancer medications. The ages of those supported ranged from 11 months to 61 years in 2025, with many patients in their most productive years of life.

For patients in Ghana, the challenges extend far beyond treatment. Many live over 200 kilometers from the nearest cancer center. Some sleep outdoors during treatment due to lack of accommodation. These are realities that ACCE works to address with compassion and urgency.

For Dr. Osei, success is not measured only in numbers.

> **“Success is dignity restored. It’s knowing a patient doesn’t have to fight this alone.”**

## The Work You Don’t See

What many donors may not realize is that ACCE has zero paid employees. Every board member and volunteer contributes their time and expertise so that 100% of donations go directly to patient treatment.

Behind every supported patient is extensive coordination:

- Reviewing applications and verifying medical and financial need
- Working with doctors and hospitals across continents
- Navigating complex treatment pathways
- Ensuring funds translate into timely, effective care

This invisible work is often what makes the difference between a patient continuing treatment or giving up.

## Strength in the Face of Challenge

There are moments when the need outweighs available resources. What keeps ACCE moving forward are the voices of the patients themselves.

One call, received years ago from a patient undergoing chemotherapy in Ghana, still resonates deeply:

> **“Please never give up on us. Without your support, many of us would die.”**

Support from family, friends, volunteers, and patients who now give back as navigators continues to fuel ACCE’s mission.

## Looking Ahead: The Road to 2026

ACCE’s vision for the future is ambitious but grounded in reality.

By 2026, ACCE aims to:

- Support 50–60 patients annually
- Raise $100,000–$200,000 to expand care in Ghana and Canada
- Launch a Patient Navigation Program in Ghana
- Strengthen early diagnosis and awareness efforts
- Build a sustainable base of monthly donors
- Strengthen digital presence, storytelling, and community engagement

Every goal is tied to one outcome: no patient left behind because of cost or circumstance.

## How You Can Be Part of the Journey

ACCE is not funded by governments or large institutions. The work is made possible entirely by individuals who believe that cancer care should be equitable and that no patient should die of cancer just because they lack the financial means for their treatment.

Whether through a one-time donation, becoming a monthly donor, volunteering, or sharing ACCE’s story, your support directly saves lives.

When you support ACCE, you are not just funding treatment.
You are restoring dignity.
You are giving hope.
You are allowing patients to live with their loved ones.
You are ensuring equity where it is needed most.
