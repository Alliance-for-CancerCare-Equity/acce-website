# Most Cervical Cancer Can Be Prevented

Cervical cancer is a preventable disease. It is entirely preventable through HPV vaccination and regular cervical screening (Pap tests and HPV tests), which detect and treat precancerous changes before they become cancer, making it highly curable when caught early.

## HPV is the common thread

Almost all cervical cancer cases are linked to the [human papillomavirus (HPV)](https://cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/reduce-your-risk/get-vaccinated/human-papillomavirus-hpv). HPV is extremely common and can spread through skin-to-skin sexual contact, even without penetration. According to the Canadian Cancer Society, about 75 percent of people will be exposed to HPV at some point in their lives. The virus usually causes no symptoms and can stay in the body quietly for years.

## Prevention works best before problems appear

HPV is the main cause of cervical cancer, so protecting yourself is important. The HPV vaccine guards against the types of HPV most likely to cause cervical cancer and works best before exposure to the virus. Even if you're already sexually active, the vaccine can still protect you from HPV types you haven't encountered yet. You can also reduce your risk by practicing safer sex using barrier methods like condoms, dental dams, or gloves, and by attending regular cervical screening with Pap tests or HPV tests.

## Routine monitoring is essential

HPV often causes no symptoms, which is why regular screening is so important. Pap tests can detect abnormal cells before they turn into cancer, while HPV tests can identify the virus itself, sometimes even before it affects the cells. Cervical cancer is most often diagnosed between ages 35 and 44. For this reason, people with a cervix who have ever been sexually active should get screened every 3 to 5 years from ages 25 to 70, even if they have had the HPV vaccine. Thanks to regular screening, the number of cervical cancer cases in Canada has dropped by nearly 60 percent since the 1970s.

## Reducing risk through access and awareness

Not everyone has the same access to HPV vaccines, accurate information, or regular cervical screening, which increases the risk of cervical cancer in some communities, especially in low-income countries. On top of that, silence and stigma around cervical health make prevention even harder. That is why ACCE provides a safe space for conversations, where people can break the stigma, share their stories, ask questions, raise awareness, and find reliable prevention information through our social media. By facing these challenges together, we believe we can create healthier communities. When cervical health is treated as a normal part of healthcare, vaccination and screening rates increase, leading to better outcomes.

## Cervical cancer prevention is a system

Prevention is not one decision or one appointment. It is an ongoing system of care that combines:

- Vaccination
- Routine screening
- Accurate information
- Access to services
- Respectful, open conversations

When these elements are in place, cervical cancer *can be prevented in the community.* Prevention succeeds not because the risk disappears, but because support arrives early enough to change outcomes.

At Alliance for CancerCare Equity, we work to make cancer prevention accessible through education, providing financial support, and awareness-raising in Canada and Ghana. Learn more by following us on social media, and share this information within your community to help people take action early and protect their health.
