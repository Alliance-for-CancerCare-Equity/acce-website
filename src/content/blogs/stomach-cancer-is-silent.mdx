# Gut Feelings Matter

*November recognizes Gastric Cancer, also known as stomach cancer, which forms when there’s a genetic mutation in the DNA of your stomach cells. This in turn can lead to a rapid growth eventually forming a tumor. These cancer cells can also spread to other parts of the body.*

# Why Awareness Matters

Causes of these mutations are still unknown to researchers. Spreading awareness to the many ways cancer can form and quickly spread in the body may allow for further support and avoiding a late diagnosis. Gastric cancer does not receive as much attention as other cancers, yet awareness may support early detection and save lives. Early detection drastically improves survival rate, also allowing for the opportunity to modify risk factors. Increasing awareness helps others recognize early symptoms, understand their risk factors and seek immediate medical attention.

# Equal Care. Equal Lives

Unfortunately, there is a great divide in regards to healthcare, where many are unable to receive equal opportunities in finding resources, screenings, or followups. Outcomes should not depend on the form of income, or the postal code in which one resides. Marginalized and high-risk communities often face barriers such as poverty, language and lack of physicians. Health equity is a matter of justice that ACCE supports.

# Know the signs. Fight the Silence

Gastric Cancer is a disease in which cancer cells form in the lining of the stomach.
Gastric cancer symptoms often don’t appear in the early stages. However, symptoms include the following:

- Loss of appetite
- Trouble swallowing
- Fatigue or weakness
- Nausea and vomiting
- Unexplained weight loss
- Heartburn and indigestion
- Feeling bloated or gassy after eating
- Stomach pain, often above your belly
- Feeling full even after eating a small meal or snack

Most of these symptoms are common in other conditions too. It is highly advised to seek out your healthcare provider for greater details.

# How can you make a difference this November?

1. Join us in spreading awareness: Share this link to help spread awareness regarding Gastric cancer. Talk about it with your relatives and friends.
2. Donate to ACCE: Donating to ACCE will allow greater support in funding patients' treatment for those in Ghana who cannot afford their treatment cost and for those in Canada who cannot afford unfunded drugs. It also helps fund patients lab tests, screening, and transportation.
3. Engage with us online: Engagement may boost visibility and allow us to reach others in need of further support.
