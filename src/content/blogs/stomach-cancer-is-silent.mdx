# Stomach Cancer is Silent

## But Your Voice Doesn’t Have To Be

November recognizes Gastric Cancer, also known as stomach cancer, which forms when there’s a genetic mutation in the DNA of your stomach cells.

It is often called a "silent" disease because, in its early stages, it rarely shows symptoms. By the time it is discovered, it has often advanced, making treatment more difficult and survival rates lower.

At the Alliance for CancerCare Equity (ACCE), we believe that silence should not cost lives. Raising awareness about the signs, risks, and the urgent need for equitable care is a critical part of our mission.

## Understanding the Risk

Stomach cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths.

While it can affect anyone, certain factors increase the risk:
- **H. pylori infection:** A common stomach bacteria that can lead to ulcers and cancer.
- **Diet:** High intake of salty, smoked, or pickled foods and low intake of fruits and vegetables.
- **Smoking:** A major risk factor for many cancers, including stomach cancer.
- **Genetics:** A family history of the disease.

Geography also plays a role. Stomach cancer rates are significantly higher in Eastern Asia, Eastern Europe, and parts of South America. In many low- and middle-income countries, lack of early detection programs means patients are often diagnosed at Stage IV.

## The Equity Gap

For a patient in a high-income country, a persistent stomach ache might lead to an endoscopy and early diagnosis.

For a patient in a resource-limited setting, that same symptom is often treated with over-the-counter antacids until the pain becomes unbearable and the cancer is untreatable.

ACCE is working to close this gap. We support patients who have been diagnosed late, ensuring they have access to palliative care, pain management, and dignity. We also advocate for better awareness so that fewer people face this diagnosis alone.

## Listening to Your Body

Because stomach cancer is silent, listening to your body is essential.

Symptoms to watch for include:
- Persistent indigestion or heartburn
- Feeling full after eating small amounts
- Unexplained weight loss
- Stomach pain
- Nausea and vomiting

If something feels wrong, advocate for yourself. See a doctor. Ask questions.

## Breaking the Silence

This November, we ask you to lend your voice to the silent fight against stomach cancer.

- **Talk about it.** Share information with your family and friends.
- **Support patients.** Your donations help ACCE provide care for those battling gastric cancer who cannot afford treatment.
- **Advocate.** push for better access to diagnostic tools in underserved communities.

Your voice has power. Use it to bring hope to those who need it most.
