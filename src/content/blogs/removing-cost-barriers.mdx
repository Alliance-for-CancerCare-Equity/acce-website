Every missed appointment or delayed treatment can change a patient’s outcome. Monthly giving helps us commit to full courses of care — not just a single infusion or scan — so patients can finish treatment with dignity and hope.

## Why monthly matters

Consistent funding allows clinics to schedule treatment with confidence, pharmacies to release medications on time, and families to plan transportation without choosing between essentials and care.

- Funds complete cycles of chemotherapy
- Reduces treatment interruptions
- Improves adherence and outcomes

> Equity is predictable — it’s built on sustained commitments, not one‑off moments.

If you’re able, consider joining as a monthly donor. Your steady support saves lives by keeping care on track.
