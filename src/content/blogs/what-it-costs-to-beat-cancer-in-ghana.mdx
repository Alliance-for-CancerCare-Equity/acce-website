Direct treatment costs are only part of the picture. Transportation, accommodation during long treatment blocks, and unfunded medications can push care out of reach without support.

## Where help goes furthest

- Completing full chemotherapy protocols
- Covering unfunded essential drugs
- Bridging diagnostics and surgery timelines

Our model targets the biggest barriers first, so each gift turns into timely, lifesaving care.
