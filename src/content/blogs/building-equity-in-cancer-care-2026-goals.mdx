# Building Equity in Cancer Care: ACCE’s Goals for 2026

A new year brings new hope, a chance for a fresh start and an opportunity to build on past initiatives. As we approach the new year, we’re excited to share how the Alliance for CancerCare Equity (ACCE) plans to turn your generosity into meaningful action in the months ahead.

The Alliance for CancerCare Equity (ACCE) plans to focus on six strategic pillars and key initiatives in 2026. These include:

*   Enhancing our digital presence and storytelling
*   Strengthening our brand identity
*   Diversifying fundraising methods and donor engagement channels
*   Building community, trust and long-term donor relationships
*   Planning two flagship campaigns to anchor growth, and
*   Strengthening the ACCE volunteer-led innovation team.

According to Dr. Ernest Osei, President and CEO of ACCE, one of the first priorities for the new year is a website revamp, fully mobile-optimized with a streamlined donation page. We want all our digital platforms to clearly communicate who we are, what we do, and why it matters, while enhancing our content marketing and impact storytelling.

## Every Dollar Counts

In 2025, ACCE supported about 20 cancer patients across Ghana and Canada. In 2026, we hope to double this number to about 50-60 patients. This year, your generous donations contributed to the $32,000 spent in cancer patient support. The goal for the new year is to double that amount to between $50,000 to $100,000.

Donors will receive transparent updates on how funds are used, to build that trust and encourage regular giving. We hope to grow the list of recurring donors to over 100 monthly supporters.

In the words of Dr Osei, **“Every dollar that we raise comes from people like you and me.”**

To promote multiple ways to give, ACCE will empower supporters to raise funds using channels like birthday fundraisers, community challenges, “sponsor a patient” campaigns, or awareness days. We plan to leverage local businesses, philanthropic companies, faith communities, and institutions for sponsorships and employee-giving campaigns.

ACCE is a volunteer-led nonprofit organization with a mission to ensure that every cancer patient receives equitable, high-quality care, regardless of their financial status. In 2025, 25 volunteers supported this cause. In 2026, we plan to strengthen this volunteer base to help with strategic goals.

Some of the initiatives we have lined up include:

*   Cancer awareness programs in Kitchener-Waterloo, and in Ghana.
*   Partnership with corporations and community organizations
*   Strengthening the Campus Engagement groups
*   Strengthening Corporate and Community Engagement and Fundraising
*   ACCE Patient Navigation and Support Program

## Creating Awareness, Addressing Stigma

In the new year, ACCE will strengthen the Patient Navigation and Support Program in Ghana, where trained navigators will guide patients through diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. This service may later be extended to Canada.

We also plan to enhance our diagnostic support with a goal of funding over 50 diagnostic procedures to reduce late–stage presentations. We recognize that a lot of people face stigma whenever they’re diagnosed with cancer. To help with that, ACCE wants to strengthen awareness and host early detection campaigns.

One of such events is the [**Empowering Communities: A Cancer Awareness and Education Event**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/empowering-communities-a-cancer-awareness-and-education-event-tickets-1977326317243?aff=oddtdtcreator&keep_tld=1) happening on March 28, 2026. We encourage you to [register](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/empowering-communities-a-cancer-awareness-and-education-event-tickets-1977326317243?aff=oddtdtcreator&keep_tld=1) and plan to attend.

## A Community of Equity

Although ACCE is a relatively new organization, we remain open to collaborations with nonprofits and partners who share our mission.

These plans are ambitious but achievable with your support and involvement. Please support our mission through giving, volunteering and sharing our posts. When you do any of these, you are saving a life and giving hope to those in need of cancer treatment.

In the words of our president and CEO:

> **“Our true success, beyond numbers, is becoming a community supporting cancer care where no one’s survival will depend on their income, or their geography or their circumstances.”**
