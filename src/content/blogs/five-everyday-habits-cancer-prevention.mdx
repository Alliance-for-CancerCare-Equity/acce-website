# Five Everyday Habits That Help Prevent Cancer

National Cancer Prevention Month is a reminder that small daily choices can protect your health. Cancer prevention does not always require major changes. Many effective actions are simple, practical, and within your control. Research shows that about 30 to 50 percent of cancers can be prevented through healthy lifestyle habits. You can start today.

Below are five everyday habits that can help reduce cancer risk. These habits apply to all ages and support long term wellbeing.

## Habit 1. Choose a balanced and plant forward diet

What you eat plays a strong role in cancer prevention. Diets rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes help protect your cells from damage.

- Eat a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables every day.
- Choose whole grains over refined grains.
- Limit processed foods and sugary drinks.
- Reduce red and processed meat intake.

According to global cancer research, diets low in fruits and vegetables increase the risk of several cancers. Fiber rich foods help support digestion and reduce inflammation. These small food choices add up over time.

## Habit 2. Stay physically active

Regular movement helps your body regulate hormones, manage weight, and strengthen your immune system. All of these factors lower cancer risk.

- Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate activity most days.
- Walking, cycling, dancing, or household chores all count.
- Reduce long periods of sitting when possible.

Studies show that regular physical activity can lower the risk of breast, colon, and endometrial cancers. You do not need intense workouts. Consistency matters more than intensity.

## Habit 3. Avoid tobacco and limit alcohol

Tobacco use remains the leading preventable cause of cancer worldwide. Alcohol also increases the risk of several cancers.

- Do not smoke or use tobacco products.
- Avoid secondhand smoke exposure.
- Limit alcohol intake or avoid it entirely.

Smoking is linked to cancers of the lung, mouth, throat, pancreas, bladder, and more. Alcohol increases the risk of breast, liver, and digestive cancers. Cutting back or quitting has benefits at any age.

## Habit 4. Protect your skin from sun damage

Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers. It is also one of the most preventable.

- Use sunscreen during outdoor activities.
- Seek shade during peak sun hours.
- Avoid tanning beds.

Even occasional sunburns can increase skin cancer risk later in life. Daily sun protection is a simple habit that protects your skin long term.

## Habit 5. Keep up with preventive care and screenings

Early detection saves lives. Preventive healthcare helps identify risks before they become serious.

- Follow recommended health checkups.
- Talk to a healthcare provider about screenings.
- Stay up to date with vaccinations when advised.

Cancer screenings can detect disease early, when treatment is most effective. Preventive care also includes learning your family health history and sharing it with your doctor.

## Why everyday habits matter

Cancer often develops over many years. Daily habits influence how your body repairs damage and responds to stress. Prevention is not about perfection. It is about reducing risk step by step.

For patients and caregivers, these habits support recovery and quality of life. For young people, they build a strong foundation for the future. For older adults, they help maintain strength and independence.

## A community effort

Cancer prevention is stronger when communities work together. Education, access to care, and support services make healthy choices easier for everyone. When organizations provide trusted information and resources, people feel empowered to take action.

Your support helps expand awareness programs, prevention education, and community outreach. Donations to Alliance for CancerCare Equity allow vital work to continue. They help reach individuals who need guidance, screenings, and hope.
