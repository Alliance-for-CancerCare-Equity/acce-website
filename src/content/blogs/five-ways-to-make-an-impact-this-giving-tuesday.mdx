Imagine a world where everyone had access to cancer care whether they could afford it or not. That’s what the Alliance for CancerCare Equity (ACCE) is trying to achieve through the support of generous donors.

GivingTuesday is the world’s largest generosity movement. Founded in 2012, its goal is to establish an annual day dedicated to giving. Whether you’re a repeat supporter or someone looking for a meaningful way to give back, here are five ways to make an impact this Giving Tuesday, Dec. 2, 2025:

1. **Organize a fundraiser for ACCE**: ACCE was created in 2022 to support patients who can't afford cancer treatment. Since then, the charity has raised over $100,000 for this cause. Your fundraiser could be a walk, run or even a drive. Set a goal of how much you want to raise per kilometer walked or run and aim to achieve it. Consider wearing branded merchandise to spread the word about your fundraiser. You can also partner with local businesses to encourage people to both shop locally while donating to the charity.

2. **Spread the word about the importance of giving**. Social media has become a tool where everyone can stay connected no matter their location. And one of its biggest impacts is amplifying awareness about a cause. So, even if you can’t be physically present to organize a fundraiser, you can share a post, story, or testimonial to inspire others to give. On and before Giving Tuesday, share graphics, and promotional posts using hashtags. Don’t forget to share the donation link and tag ACCE for the possibility of future donations.

3. **Volunteer for ACCE.** Many nonprofit organizations rely on volunteers to run. Volunteering with ACCE for even a couple of hours weekly can ramp up donations on Giving Tuesday. You can help by phoning or emailing past donors to consider donating on Giving Tuesday, creating social media posts to spread awareness, planning events and helping with administrative tasks. Please send an email to [volunteer@allianceforcancercareequity.ca](mailto:volunteer@allianceforcancercareequity.ca) if you’re interested in volunteering.

4. **Make a one-time donation**. As obvious as this sounds, it’s the most important way to give back. Charities need money to further their cause. Consider donating to the Alliance for CancerCare Equity to fund life-saving treatments for patients in need. Even the smallest contribution can make a big difference. A single donation helps fund critical services, including providing treatment support, providing medication, and supporting families.

5. **Become a regular donor**: Signing up to be a regular donor is one of the most impactful ways to sustain a nonprofit’s mission year-round. You can opt to be a monthly donor where your $10 or $20 monthly donations create a reliable, ongoing impact. A predictable source of donation allows ACCE to plan programs more effectively, respond to urgent patient needs, and support long-term research initiatives.

Giving Tuesday is more than just one day of generosity, it’s a reminder that everyone can collectively change the lives of those around us. Whether you donate, volunteer, fundraise, or simply share the message, your support helps move us closer to our mission of ensuring that every cancer patient receives equitable, high-quality care, regardless of their financial status.
