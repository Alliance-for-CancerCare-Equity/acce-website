# Five Ways to Make an Impact This Giving Tuesday

GivingTuesday is the world’s largest generosity movement. Founded in 2012, its goal is to establish an annual day dedicated to giving.

Celebrated on the Tuesday following Thanksgiving (in the U.S.), Black Friday, and Cyber Monday, GivingTuesday unleashes the power of people and organizations to transform their communities and the world.

For the Alliance for CancerCare Equity (ACCE), GivingTuesday is more than a date on the calendar. It is a lifeline. It is a day when our community comes together to ensure that no patient is left behind because they cannot afford treatment.

Here are five meaningful ways you can make an impact with ACCE this GivingTuesday.

## 1. Make a One-Time Donation

The most direct way to help is to fund a patient’s treatment.

Cancer care is expensive. In Ghana, many patients must pay out-of-pocket for every scan, every round of chemotherapy, and every surgery. When the money runs out, the treatment stops.

Your donation, no matter the size, goes directly to patient care.
- **$50** can cover transportation for a patient to get to the hospital.
- **$100** can pay for essential lab tests.
- **$500** can fund a cycle of life-saving chemotherapy.

## 2. Become a Monthly Donor

Cancer treatment is a marathon, not a sprint.

Monthly donors provide the steady, reliable support that allows ACCE to commit to patients for the long haul. Knowing that we have consistent funding means we can say "yes" to a patient today, knowing we can still support them next month and the month after.

Even $20 a month adds up to a significant impact over a year.

## 3. Share Our Stories

Awareness is a form of giving.

Many people are unaware of the disparities in cancer care globally. By sharing ACCE’s stories, blog posts, and patient testimonials on social media, you amplify our voice.

Tell your friends why you support ACCE. Share a link to our website. Use your platform to advocate for equity in healthcare.

## 4. Dedicate Your Giving

GivingTuesday is a perfect time to honor a loved one.

You can make a donation in memory of someone lost to cancer or in honor of a survivor. This is a powerful way to turn personal grief or gratitude into a legacy of hope for others.

When you donate, let us know who you are honoring, and we will recognize their legacy in our work.

## 5. Volunteer Your Time

Time is one of the most valuable gifts you can give.

ACCE is run entirely by volunteers. We are always looking for passionate individuals to join our team. Whether you have skills in fundraising, social media, event planning, or patient navigation, there is a place for you here.

Volunteering with ACCE is an opportunity to use your talents to save lives directly.

## The Power of "We"

GivingTuesday proves that when we act together, we can change the world.

At ACCE, we believe that financial status should never determine who lives and who dies. This GivingTuesday, join us in making that belief a reality.

Your generosity is the bridge between a patient and the care they desperately need.
