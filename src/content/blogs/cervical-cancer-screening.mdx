# Early Detection Saves Lives: Why Cervical Cancer Screening Matters

Cervical cancer is one of the most preventable cancers, yet many people are still diagnosed too late. This is because cervical cancer often develops without symptoms in its early stages. Feeling healthy does not always mean there is no risk, which is why routine screening is so important.

Most cervical cancers are caused by the [human papillomavirus](https://cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/reduce-your-risk/get-vaccinated/human-papillomavirus-hpv), also known as [HPV](https://cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/reduce-your-risk/get-vaccinated/human-papillomavirus-hpv). HPV is very common and is spread through sexual activity, including skin to skin contact. The virus can remain in the body for up to 10 years without causing symptoms.

Screening can detect HPV or early cell changes before cancer develops, allowing treatment to happen early or preventing cancer altogether.

## Who Should Be Screened

Anyone with a cervix can get cervical cancer. [Screening is recommended every 5 years for people ages 25 to 70 who have ever had sexual contact](https://cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/find-cancer-early/get-screened-for-cervical-cancer/when-should-i-be-screened-for-cervical-cancer), even if they are no longer sexually active or have received the HPV vaccine. The HPV vaccine does not protect against all types of HPV, which is why regular screening is still important.

## Types of Screening Tests

There are different methods used to screen for cervical cancer, but [Pap test](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/cervical-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/screening-tests/pap-test.html) and [HPV test](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/cervical-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/screening-tests/hpv-test.html) are the most common. Pap test looks for abnormal cell changes on the cervix after they have begun, while HPV test looks for the virus that causes most cervical cancers and can detect it before cancer develops. Both tests are effective, and which one is used depends on what is available in your area.

## Where to Get Screened

In Canada, cervical cancer screening is available through family doctors, community health centres, sexual health clinics, and public health programs. Depending on the province, screening may use Pap tests, HPV tests, or both. You can find a screening program through the [Canadian Cancer Society website](https://cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/find-cancer-early/get-screened-for-cervical-cancer/how-do-i-find-a-cervical-cancer-screening-program).

In Ghana, access to screening can vary by region. Screening may be offered at hospitals, clinics, community outreach programs, or during organized screening campaigns. Availability of tests may differ, but early detection remains the goal.

If you are unsure where to get screened, ask a healthcare provider, local clinic, or community health worker about options in your area or [contact ACCE](https://www.allianceforcancercareequity.ca/contact-us).

## Take Action

Getting screened protects your health and supports your community. You can take action in 5 simple steps:

1. **Get screened** – Protect your health and schedule your cervical cancer screening. Encourage friends and family to do the same.
2. **Share information** – Spread awareness about cervical cancer and the importance of early detection.
3. **Follow us on social media** – Stay informed with updates, resources, and health tips from ACCE.
4. [**Subscribe to our newsletter**](https://www.allianceforcancercareequity.ca/newsletters) – Receive helpful information about cervical cancer prevention and health programs.
5. **Support ACCE** – [Make a donation](https://www.allianceforcancercareequity.ca/giving-options) to help expand education and access to screening programs in Canada and Ghana.

Every step helps ensure more people get screened early and can save lives.
