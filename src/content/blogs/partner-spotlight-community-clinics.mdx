From infusion pumps to ultrasound units, the “small” things are often the difference between cancelled appointments and timely care. Our partners run lean, patient-first operations that stretch every donation to meet real clinical needs.

## What your support equips

- Infusion chairs and pumps for chemotherapy suites
- Ultrasound for guided procedures
- Lab analyzers and monitors for safe treatment

Beyond delivery, we support installation, commissioning, and training — so equipment is safe, reliable, and productive for the long term.
