  title: Join Us in the Fight for Cancer Care Equity
  subtitle: At the Alliance for CancerCare Equity (ACCE), we believe that no one should be denied cancer treatment because of where they live or how much money they have. Yet every day, patients in Ghana and underserved communities in Canada are forced to choose between food, shelter, and lifesaving care.
