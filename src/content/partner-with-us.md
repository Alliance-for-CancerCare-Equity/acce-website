  title: Partner With Us
  subtitle: 'Partner with ACCE: Advance Equity. Transform Lives.'
  p1: At the Alliance for CancerCare Equity (ACCE), we are on a mission to make cancer care accessible to those who need it most—regardless of income, geography, or background. But we cannot do it alone. Achieving equity in cancer care takes partnership. It takes people and organizations willing to stand in the gap and say, "Everyone deserves a chance to fight—and survive—cancer."
  p2: We invite individuals, businesses, faith communities, and organizations to join us as partners in this life-saving work.
  p3: When you partner with ACCE, you become part of a movement that is providing real, tangible support to cancer patients in Ghana and underserved communities in Canada. Your partnership can take many forms—financial contributions, in-kind support, employee giving campaigns, sponsorships, co-branded fundraising initiatives, or collaborative awareness efforts.
