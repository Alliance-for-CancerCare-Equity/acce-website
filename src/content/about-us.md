    who_we_are_title: Who We Are
    who_we_are_p1: The Alliance for CancerCare Equity (ACCE) is a registered charity in Canada dedicated to advancing equity in cancer care. We passionately believe that no individual should lose their life to cancer simply because they lack the financial means to afford treatment. Furthermore, we are committed to ensuring that a patient's financial circumstances never dictate their chances of surviving a cancer diagnosis.
    who_we_are_p2: At Alliance for CancerCare Equity, we've embarked on an ambitious mission to cover the costs of cancer treatment and related expenses for patients who lack the financial means to pay for their care. By doing so, we aim to alleviate the financial burden on families and empower patients to focus on their recovery journey without financial worry.
    who_we_are_p3: Join us in our quest to redefine cancer care. Together, we can ensure that every individual, regardless of their financial situation, receives the treatment they need to fight cancer and reclaim their future. Together, let's make life-changing compassionate care accessible to all who need it most.
