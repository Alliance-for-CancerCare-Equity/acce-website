### Event Overview
The Alliance for CancerCare Equity, in partnership with the Waterloo Wellington Regional Cancer Program (Ontario Health: Cancer Care Ontario), the KW4 Ontario Health Team, SCOPE (a virtual support team for primary care providers), K-W Immigration Partnership Council and the International Migration Research Centre warmly invites you to a special transformative community event dedicated to cancer education, awareness, prevention, and early detection.

### Why Attend?
Cancer is not an equal opportunity disease. Systemic barriers, cultural stigma, and lack of access to the right information continue to negatively impact outcomes for minority communities in Canada. Many are diagnosed late or unaware of the services available to them. Thus, cancer outcomes remain significantly worse for racialized and immigrant populations in Canada, often due to misinformation, cultural stigma, and lack of access to prevention and screening resources.

However, **Early detection saves lives.** Access to information changes outcomes.

Together, we can build a future where everyone has an equal chance at cancer prevention, treatment, and survival.

### Key Messages
*   Importance of screening and early detection. Screening guidelines and access
*   Cancer prevention and modifiable risk factors (diet, lifestyle). Understanding risk factors
