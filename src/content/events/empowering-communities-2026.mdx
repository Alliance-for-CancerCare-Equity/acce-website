### Event Overview
The Alliance for CancerCare Equity, in partnership with the Waterloo Wellington Regional Cancer Program (Ontario Health: Cancer Care Ontario), the KW4 Ontario Health Team, SCOPE (a virtual support team for primary care providers), K-W Immigration Partnership Council and the International Migration Research Centre warmly invites you to a special transformative community event dedicated to cancer education, awareness, prevention, and early detection.

This is more than just an event, it’s a movement toward health equity, informed communities, and empowered individuals. Whether you are a community member, caregiver, healthcare professional, or someone affected by cancer, your presence matters.

### Goal
Increase cancer awareness, encourage early detection and screening, and educate minority communities (Blacks, immigrants, etc.) about cancer prevention, treatment, survivorship and to honor Margaret Walton Roberts, IMRC co-founder and past IP Council member.

### Target Audience
*   Black and racialized communities
*   New immigrants and Newcomers
*   General public in Kitchener-Waterloo Region

### Why Attend?
Cancer is not an equal opportunity disease. Systemic barriers, cultural stigma, and lack of access to the right information continue to negatively impact outcomes for minority communities in Canada. Many are diagnosed late or unaware of the services available to them. Thus, cancer outcomes remain significantly worse for racialized and immigrant populations in Canada, often due to misinformation, cultural stigma, and lack of access to prevention and screening resources.

However, **Early detection saves lives.** Access to information changes outcomes.

Together, we can build a future where everyone has an equal chance at cancer prevention, treatment, and survival.

### Key Messages
*   Importance of screening and early detection. Screening guidelines and access
*   Cancer prevention and modifiable risk factors (diet, lifestyle). Understanding risk factors
*   Cancer in Black and immigrant communities: understanding the data
*   Access to screening services
*   Treatment options and care pathways
*   Navigating treatment and survivorship
*   Available resources
*   Navigating the Canadian healthcare system
*   Addressing cultural myths, misinformation and barriers to equitable healthcare
*   Reducing systemic barriers to care

### What to Expect
*   Expert-led education sessions on cancer awareness and prevention
*   Culturally relevant discussions on reducing barriers to care
*   Practical guidance for early screening and self-advocacy
*   Connection with healthcare providers and community support organizations
*   An inclusive, supportive space for learning, sharing, and taking action
*   Honoring Margaret Walton Roberts, IMRC co-founder and past IP Council member
