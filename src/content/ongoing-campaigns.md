    title: Ongoing ACCE Campaigns
    intro_p1: At the Alliance for CancerCare Equity (ACCE), we are committed to ensuring that no one is denied cancer treatment because of financial hardship. Every month, we support patients in Ghana and Canada—covering treatment costs, medications, and transportation. But the need is great, and the costs keep rising.
    intro_p2: That’s why, from time to time, we launch special fundraising campaigns. These campaigns help us respond to urgent cases, expand our support to more patients, and sustain ongoing treatments.
    intro_p3: Each campaign is a call to action—a chance for our community to step in and give hope where it's needed most. Every dollar you give directly impacts a life.
    intro_p4: Together, we can close the gap in cancer care and bring healing within reach.
