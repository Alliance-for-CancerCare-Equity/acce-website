            Who We Are
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-6">
            The Alliance for CancerCare Equity (ACCE) is a registered charity in
            Canada dedicated to advancing equity in cancer care. We passionately
            believe that no individual should lose their life to cancer simply
            because they lack the financial means to afford treatment.
            Furthermore, we are committed to ensuring that a patient&apos;s
            financial circumstances never dictate their chances of surviving a
            cancer diagnosis.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8">
            At Alliance for CancerCare Equity, we&apos;ve embarked on an
            ambitious mission: to cover the costs of cancer treatment and
            related expenses for patients who lack the financial means to pay
            for their care. By doing so, we aim to alleviate the financial
            burden on families and empower patients to focus on their recovery
            journey without financial worry.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8">
            Join us in our quest to redefine cancer care. Together, we can
            ensure that every individual, regardless of their financial
            situation, receives the treatment they need to fight cancer and
            reclaim their future. Together, let&apos;s make life-changing
            compassionate care accessible to all who need it most.
